# T.I.M.E
A Python 3.7-Based ASCII text game engine.
By John Stubblefield

T.I.M.E, short for Text Interplacer Movement Engine, and is a game engine designed in python 3.7 to allow for the movement of text characters on the fly. HOWEVER! in order for T.I.M.E to work, you need the python module, keyboard, installed in order for user-input to function. The code is very modular; cut-and-pasting parts of code will allow for modifications to the basic game structure.

To Do:
1. Modify source code to allow for ease of use with game constants
2. Add GUI frontend for derivative game creation.
