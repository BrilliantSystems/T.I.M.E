# T.I.M.E
A Python 3.7-Based ASCII text game engine.
By John Stubblefield

T.I.M.E, short for Text Interplacer Movement Engine, is a game engine designed in python 3.7 to allow for the movement of text characters on the fly. HOWEVER! in order for T.I.M.E to work, you need the python keyboard module installed in order for user input to function. The code is very modular; cut and pasting parts of code will allow for modifications to the basic game structure.
